# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

To test on local node:

```shell
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat --network localhost run scripts/deployToken.js
Go to frontend -> npm run start
Frontend: <http://localhost:3000/>
Node: <http://localhost:8545/>
```
